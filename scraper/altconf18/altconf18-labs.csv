Adding Visual Recognition Capabilities to Your iOS App using Watson Studio and Core ML,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,10:00-11:00,Lab Room 1,"<div class=""schedule__speaker"">Joshua Zheng, Devin Conley, Nicholas Bourdakas & Tom Markiewicz</div>
Think you can build an awesome AI-powered app for iOS in an hour? You can with IBM‚Äôs Watson and Apple‚Äôs Core ML. You‚Äôll train your own machine learning models and use them in your apps quickly. Your challenge? Build an app that couples AI with videos and photos to identify and classify real world objects. At the end of the lab, you will have a working iOS app that is able to detect different types of connectors (USB, HDMI, Thunderbolt, etc). Sign up here: http://ibm.biz/IBM_AltConf_Labs."
Core Data,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,10:00-12:00,Lab Room 2,"<div class=‚Äúschedule__speaker‚Äù>Florian Burger</div><br/>A lot of people are struggling with Core Data. At first sight, Apple‚Äôs persistence framework seems complicated, requires a lot of overhead in your code and there have been reports that it is slow (anyone remember Brent‚Äôs [infamous article for NetNewsWire‚Äôs mark-as-read problem](http://inessential.com/2010/02/26/on_switching_away_from_core_data) from 8 years ago?) and that it shouldn‚Äôt be used in ‚Äúsimple‚Äù apps.

I‚Äôve been developing for iOS (n√©e iPhone OS) since 1.0 for clients of all sizes, and in almost every project, Core Data was used with great success! I am a big fan. üôÇ

Come to my Core Data lab and ask me anything regarding everyone‚Äôs favorite persistent layer. Or share war stories. Or bring your code and we can try to fix the problem together."

Fix Data Privacy & Password Security in your Apps!,2018-06-06,2018-06-06,10:00-12:00,Lab Room 2,"<div class=‚Äúschedule__speaker‚Äù>David Szabo</div> 
Like Smokey the Bear says, only YOU can prevent password breaches!
The world is shifting. Users and governments are demanding more privacy and security.
Developers: you can and should leverage this as an advantage for your product.
On June 6th, join us for a practical, hands-on workshop to learn how to use existing code to build encryption and password security into your tech without having to become an security expert.

This free workshop will consist of two parts: 1) How to implement End-to-End Encryption to keep your product's data secure from cloud providers, hackers and curious eyes and 2) How to implement a password hashing technique that can't be breached.

It's time to take your app into the Augmented Reality and Machine Learning era. Learn how to create an app that delivers augmented reality-based r√©sum√©s with Visual Recognition. The iOS app recognizes the face and presents you with the AR view that displays a r√©sum√© of the person in the camera view. The app uses Watson Visual Recognition and Core ML to classify the image and then uses that classification to get details about the person from data stored in an IBM Cloudant NoSQL database. The images are classified offline using a deep neural network that is trained by Visual Recognition. Sign up here: http://ibm.biz/IBM_AltConf_Labs."
