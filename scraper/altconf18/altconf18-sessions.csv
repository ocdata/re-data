Moving to Subscriptions,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,09:00-09:45,Room 1,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Owens.png"" />Christian Owens</div><br>Major software products have moved to a subscription business model in the last couple of years - some successfully, some attracting considerable customer backlash.

We've seen many indie Mac developers considering it but unsure how to do it, from figuring out and testing the best pricing and billing models to avoiding backlash to managing the technical aspects of running both one-off customers and recurring subscriptions in parallel.

To help developers considering that approach, I propose a fireside chat where I would moderate a discussion with several leaders of awesome Mac products who have both strong opinions, and real life experience in that tricky move. Some of them our customers, some of them friends of us - all of them with really interesting, and often different views on the topic.

We are currently discussing WWDC presence with them, so here's an indicative list of the key developers with whom I'd run the session (3-4 of them will join):
- Opposed to subscriptions: RogueAmoeba or Panic
- Enthusiastic on subscriptions: Framer, Ulysses or Tower
- Offering a 3rd, in-between approach: Sketch, Smile Software or Setapp

The session will focus on practical examples of what went well and what went horribly wrong, to make it very actionable for the audience - no fluff, sales pitch or vague ideas, just concrete learnings, both from a technical and a business standpoints."
Building Apps for Everyone,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,09:00-09:45,Room 2,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Devesa.png"" />Daniel Devesa Derksen-Staats</div><br>It is the moment you have been working so hard for. You press the ‘Submit’ button. Your app is now on its way to the App Store. In just a few days, your app is going to be available globally. But… is it really?

Any developer of an app with an aim of reaching a global audience needs to localise the app (most of us do that), but also to make it accessible! In this talk we will try to provide a few techniques for improving those two areas of your apps from the points of view of the code, the use of tools we have available and the users’ expected experience.

A series of examples will be presented, showing how some of your users may perceive your app when localisation and accessibility are not correctly implemented or not implemented at all.

You would freak out if the ‘Back’ button was on the right side of the navigation bar, but that is what users that speak right-to-left written languages expect. If a modal view was presented without a ‘Close/Done’ button, you would consider it a bug, but it may exactly be what you are giving to blind users.

Smartphones, apps and the whole Apple ecosystem has helped us develop much more inclusive apps that anyone can use. But we can do better by building apps for everyone."
A Pre-Success Story,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,10:00 - 10:45,Room 1,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Hixon.png"" />Dan Hixon</div><br>We have all heard and been inspired by success stories. Tales of success are great! From Apollo XI to Falcon Heavy, the original Macintosh to the iPhone– it’s so satisfying when the odds seem against us and yet we prevail. The problem with success stories is that they are only told by the people who have succeeded. This is called survivorship bias. [https://www.xkcd.com/1827/] “Never stop buying lottery tickets…”

 I’ve been self-employed for two and a half years trying to make a living in the App Store. My goal is to be earning enough money to provide for my family. I’m not there yet but I have made money. I have also checked items off my bucket list because l've been trying to achieve this goal. I want to share my story precisely because it isn’t a bona-fide success story yet. I hope I can inspire you with it–I hope my talk will help you try something you’ve been wanting to try.

I will tell stories of my business. My business partner and I travel to remote and beautiful places to capture aerial videos for our relaxation and meditation app. To make an omelet you must break eggs; We’ve crashed about $10k worth of quadcopters. I'll tell 4 drone crash stories - how they shaped our business and attitudes about failure. I'll tell the story of us attending WWDC and Alt-Conf last year while sleeping in our car.

I’ll talk about our marketing efforts, pricing strategies, etc.  The difficulty we have, as artists, to promote ourselves and our product.  The necessity of living on a tight budget has been a mother of invention for me. Resulting in new skills, personality traits, and possibilities. "

I hate public speaking. So why do I keep doing it?,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,13:00 - 13:10,Room 2,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Diaz.png"" />Francisco Diaz</div><br>Last year, after a talk I gave in my hometown someone asked me """"Why do you give talks?"""" I couldn't answer honestly.

The first reaction I get when I hear public speaking is panic. Every time I need to jump on stage I feel that cold sweat running down the back of my neck.

Why do I keep doing it if it’s so uncomfortable?

In this talk, I’ll not only try to answer that question but also tackle some of the most common misunderstandings surrounding tech talks. Is the speaker the most technically capable? Do they have a special knowledge about the topic they’re discussing?

The best professionals I’ve worked with in my career have been great communicators. As with any skill, this needs to be trained. I'll argue that public speaking is a great way to improve our communication skills and to get out of our comfort zone."

We will go through criteria to evaluate that, practical use cases of incorporating ML models on device, and how to bootstrap the training process for creating machine learning models that will run on device (iOS). You may think that lots of data, compute power, time, and expertise are necessary to train custom models; however, this is not the case! Using techniques such as transfer learning and taking inspiration from the plentiful resources from industry and academia, you can get started doing this now. 

In this talk, we will go through training custom machine learning models using Tensor Flow across different domains (image classification, audio classification, & more). And, yes, we will move beyond the dog / cat classifier.

Additionally, we will cover the state of ML for iOS: what has been available since iOS 11 (Core ML, Vision, etc), announcements from WWDC 2018, and Swift for Tensor Flow."

I also talk about why it's important for developers to talk directly to customers and how we have empowered our mobile devs to engage with their users and to listen to their feedback in a way that helps drive product development."
Shared or Mutable: Pick One,2018-06-06,2018-06-06,09:00 - 09:45,Room 2,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Heo.png"" />Greg Heo</div><br>Having shared mutable state is often the default for our applications: a view with a lot of properties that gets passed around, or an app delegate accessible from everywhere that holds state. Shared mutable state can be the source of many headaches — it makes it difficult to trace through your programs, and hard to reason about concurrency.

In this session, we'll look at examples of *why* this is the case and two ways of *how* to fix it: 1) use shared but immutable state; or 2) mutable but unshared state. Between shared and mutable, you should pick just one and by the end of this talk you'll know how to make that choice."

• The benefits of Apple Pencil for users and what features it works well for.
• How to detect the Pencil and distinguish it from finger touches.
• How to increase realism and responsiveness using coalesced and predicted touches.
• Performance. While this is highly dependent on your codebase, I can share some general tips for using Instruments to identify bottlenecks and some possible ways to make your code faster."

Wether it's my calendar, my contacts, my location, I want as a user to be able to use an app without all of those attacks in my privacy. I want to summarise everything an iOS developer should do to ensure the most critical user can still use my app in some regards, and not just say ""I need all your information"" like on other platforms. This is the beauty of iOS, being able to fine grained (although not enough) so let's do this all together, as a beautiful community concerned by Privacy. "
Millions of customers. Billions of dollars. Real-world iOS Architecture at Scale.,2018-06-07,2018-06-07,13:00 - 13:45,Room 1,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Kaler.png"" />Parveen Kaler</div><br>The architecture for the Item Page in Walmart's iOS App has evolved from 50,000 lines of Objective-C sitting on top of a REST API implemented as a UITableView to much less Swift code sitting on top of a GraphQL API implemented as a UICollectionView.

We will talk about the evolutionary process.  We will talk about lessons learned over the years.  The pros/cons of different architecture decisions."
HomeKit Hidden Opportunities For Developers,2018-06-07,2018-06-07,13:00 - 13:45,Room 2,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Spivack.png"" />Robert Spivack</div><br>HomeKit is Apple's official foray into Smart Home automation systems.  HomeKit brings modern user interface and user experience paradigms to the stodgy world of traditional overpriced and proprietary control solutions costing up to $100,000 or more.

While off to a good start, HomeKit has many limitations which has made it an easy target of ridicule by old school professional systems integrators.

A few innovative integrators are swimming upstream selling and installing systems based on HomeKit but face many obstacles trying to match the capability of existing competitors.  This talk by a systems integrator “in the trenches” will present a summary of the current limitations encountered with HomeKit highlighting the opportunities for indie developers to help bridge the gap.

The focus is on presenting product ideas for embracing and extending HomeKit with profitable complementary software apps and services to solve these limitations.

Home automation is a vertical market that is currently undergoing explosive growth and Apple HomeKit has the potential to become a dominant solution.  Developers with the right skills and interest can find  interesting product and revenue opportunities that most are overlooking.

The market demand is there, the products are not (yet)."

Dates and Time By Example,2018-06-07,2018-06-07,14:00 - 14:45,Room 2,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Kelley.png"" />Jeff Kelley</div><br>Have you ever had a bug that dealt with dates and times? Dealing with time zones, Daylight Saving Time, and the like can make the hair on the back of even the most experienced developer's neck stand up. We all know how to tell time and how calendars work, and yet these bugs are terrifying. Why? Using Swift as a lens to walk through common problems, we’ll explore writing date and time code that’s correct and easy to understand. You’ll leave with an approach to solving calendrical calculations without fear, new tools for handling these problems in your code, and a huge appreciation for the people behind the libraries that make this possible."

Implementing a New Diagnostic Tool for Slack Notifications ,2018-06-05,2018-06-05,16:00 - 16:45,Room 1,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Thomas.png"" />Kaya Thomas</div><br>Notifications are an essential part of using messaging apps. If you use an app like Slack for work, not receiving notifications can have serious consequences. At Slack, we created a diagnostic tool so that users can have better context to how their notifications work. The tool checks their device settings, Slack specific settings, push token and sends a test notification if possible. With the tool we give the user actionable steps to fix anything that could potentially keep them from receiving notifications. I worked as the iOS engineer on this project and in this talk I want to explain why a diagnostic tool like this can be a game changer for apps that depend on notifications and how I implemented the tool using reactive programming. As a takeaway, the audience should have an understanding on how creating diagnostic tools can help empower their users to have better understanding of their settings as well as how to use reactive programming to cleanly implement such a tool."

Your feed limps along with the occasional stall or maybe you're trying to build a camera app but it seems to lag quite a bit behind reality.  Contrary to popular opinion, our software is becoming increasingly demanding at a rate that easily exceeds how quickly our devices are improving.

The talk explains how to track overall performance, find performance problems and how to fix a few big ones. Sprinkled throughout are 10 Rules for Good Performance."
"Implement Apple’s “Security at Its Core” Approach in Your Apps Across iOS, Android, Web and the Cloud",2018-06-05,2018-06-05,10:00 - 10:45,Room 2,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Szabo.png"" />David Szabo</div><br>Apple is famous for building security into the core of every Apple product: secure auth, user device management via iCloud-hosted keychains, End-to-End Encrypted iMessage and more. But what happens when your apps run on Android, in browsers and in the cloud where you can’t take Apple’s security with you? David Szabo of Virgil Security, the company behind Twilio’s End-to-End Encrypted Messaging, will walk us through how companies like WhatsApp and Apple implemented cross-platform security and how you too can turn on these features with simple, open source building blocks to make privacy a feature and not a bug in your product.

10 years of app marketing failures with occasional successes,2018-06-06,2018-06-06,16:00 - 16:45,Room 2,"<div class=""schedule__speaker""><img src=""http://altconf.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/michaels.png"" />Josh Michaels</div><br>As the App Store approaches the 10 year mark one topic that deserves full review is marketing. From the early days of the App Store to today the techniques for marketing apps have changed dramatically. As in all growth markets, attention became harder to get as the size of the market grew. Today techniques that worked just years ago will fail. Understanding the history of marketing in the App Store will help you avoid wasting time using old techniques that no longer work. So if you are thinking of e-mailing or tweeting at a bunch of blog writers to promote your app stop and come to this talk!

In this talk, Josh will review his long string of marketing efforts in support of his independent apps. From ""Ow My Balls!"" to ""Earthlapse"" and ""Magic Fireplace"" Josh has experienced a wide range of successes and failures in which marketing (or the lack of it) played a crucial role. Josh will dispel a variety of myths about app marketing and featuring and provide examples of tactics NOT to use when promoting your app. For winning tactics, you'll have to find another talk. This talk is a must-attend for anyone looking to ship their own apps."
